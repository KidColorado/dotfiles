MonokaiGray
===========

A Sublime Text 3 color scheme, the same as Monokai dark, but has "true" gray backgrounds. Useful with themes where the yellowey background of Monokai feels out of place.

Here's a preview of what it looks like with some code I got [here](https://wiki.python.org/moin/SimplePrograms) using the [Wombat Theme](https://sublime.wbond.net/packages/Wombat%20Theme):
